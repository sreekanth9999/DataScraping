# DataScraping

The task was to scrape the entire data from the EAI database site and store it in an AWS S3 bucket.
The website has provided with the API but I tried scraping the data using basic python packages.
It takes around 4 hours to scrape the entire data from the site and automatically store it in S3 bucket using boto3 package in python.

Please find the link to check the scraped data stored as a csv file:
